    question: "When can I withdraw the money?",
    answer:
      "In general, your account will be topped up at 8pm each day,  \
      once your work is completed (and approved if necessary). \
      However, please note that you won't be able to access your money \
      when the cut-off date approaches, which is typically 72 hours \
      before your company processes payroll. Don't worry though, \
      Qiribu will notify you in advance about the upcoming cut-off \
      date so you can plan accordingly.",
